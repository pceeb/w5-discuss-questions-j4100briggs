## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  
    The data will consist of looking at differences in fish diet and anthropogenic stressors among fish from three different islands. This will be determined by collecting bacteria sequences from the fish gut microbiome and analyzing the differences among the fish based on location.

2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).
    The data we are handling will be sequences of bacteria found in the microbiome of fish gut.

3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  
    We will be analyzing the data to see the differences between bacterial microbiomes among fish from three different islands in French Polynesia. Analyzing the data to see the differences in bacterial microbiome will allow for us to determine the differences in diet from the three different islands. 

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  
    The output of the code will allow for the QIIME2 package to visually present the data for a research paper in an easy to comprehend way.

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).  
    I will be using the sed function to process and clean up the data files to only contain the data we need to analyze. After that, QIIME2 will be used to analyze and plot the data into visual graphics.

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).
    I am still confused on what way we will be analyzing the data, but I contacted my mentor to discuss with him the plans for the project. I am also concerned about the actual coding of the data and making sure that I am analyzing the data correctly.
